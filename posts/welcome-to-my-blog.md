# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my new blog! This is the first post on my brand new static blog, built with a custom static site generator.

## What to Expect

Here I'll be sharing:
- **Technical tutorials** and code examples
- **Personal projects** and experiences  
- **Thoughts** on web development and technology
- **Tips and tricks** I've learned along the way

## Features of This Blog

This blog is built with a custom static site generator that includes:

- ✅ **Markdown support** with extended syntax
- ✅ **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks

- ✅ **Dark/light theme** toggle

## Sample Code

Here's a quick example of what code highlighting looks like:

```javascript
function greetVisitor(name) {
  const message = `Welcome to the blog, ${name}!`;
  console.log(message);
  return message;
}

greetVisitor('Reader');
```
